Hello Everyone!
  My name is Joe.  I have worked at Nationwide Ins for nearly 17 years.  I have been in my current relationship for nearly 8 years.  I have 3 children currently and am working on adopting a 4th.  I was just promoted to be a python programmer, so that is why I am trying to learn git!
  
  Thanks,
  Joe
